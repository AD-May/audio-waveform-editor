---UI---
1. if user left clicks, the audio will seek to that point in playback: done
1. add indicator for selection 
	- if no line with class start is on bar, right clicking will add a green bar with arrow to a specific time on the waveform
	- if start line already displayed, and time selected is before current start bar, right clicking again will move start bar to current position
	- if start line already displayed, and time selected is after current start line, right clicking again will add a red bar with arrow to a specific time on waveform
	- if two lines already on bar (segment already selected) another click will start process back over (end bar removed, start bar moved to new click position)
2. if start and end bars on svg, get time selection and save to state (selection, setSelection)

---AudioLogic---

1. If there is not a start and end for a selection, lock the slider.
2. If there are both selection.startTime and selection.endTime values, take selection state Timeframe and add appropriate node and pass the value of that slider to 
.setValueAtTime(sliderValue, selection startTime) based on prop data from Tooltip.tsx (gain, balance).


selection = (point, null) - case 1: add end line if screenX is greater than point (set selection (point, screenX)), case 2: move point if screenX is less than point (set selection (screenX, null))
selection = (point, point) - case 1: move start point if screenX is less than point[0] or greater than point[1] (set selection (screenX, null))
if (point, null) or (point, point) and screenX is === point[0] - case 1: set selection = null
selection = null - case 1: set selection to (screenX, null)
