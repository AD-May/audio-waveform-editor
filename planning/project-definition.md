# Audio Waveform Editor

1. *What is the project?* - This project is a project for editing audio based on waveform-visualized data input. It will be written in **TypeScript**, using a **React** frontend, and will use the **Web Audio API** and **D3.js** for visualizing waveform data and the **File API** for working with the upload file. Users will be able to upload an audio file, and that data will be converted into a waveform format. Users will be able to edit the audio based on waveform data and will be able to export the new audio to their device.

2. *What is the MVP?* - The Minimum Viable Product is a **UI that allows users to upload audio from their device**, **displays the audio in waveform format**, allows the user to **pan or zoom into sections of the waveform**, **allows users to play/pause or drag an indicator for where they want to be in the audio**, **allows the user to edit the audio with fade/trim/adjusting the volume**, and **export the modified audio**.

3. *Nice to haves?* - A sleek and extremely intuitive UI, the ability to post the audio to social media, the ability to accept audio greater than 10MB, the ability to export at a higher quality/bitrate.

4. *When will the project be complete?* - When the MVP has been implemented, there are no errors in the MVP, and the UI has full initial styling.
